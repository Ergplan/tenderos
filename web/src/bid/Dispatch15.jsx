        The sizing above works hour by hour. This takes the plant it chose and dispatches it in 15-minute time blocks for every
        year of the PPA, one HiGHS run per year with that year's degradation: biomass and thermal stay at or above their
        technical minimum in every block and move by no more than their ramp rate per block (%/min × 15); the battery charges
        from renewable output only and never charges and discharges in the same block; the tender's supply floors are checked
        on the 15-minute delivery. Solar and wind profiles are hourly, so each hour is split into four blocks along the
        hour's trend, keeping its energy. A time-block floor is checked in every 15-minute block on its own, a block short of it
        paid at its penalty multiple of the tariff. The Excel workbook has a summary by year, the months, and every year hour by
        hour (8,760 rows a year); the ZIP has one CSV per year at 15 minutes (35,040 rows) and the summary.
